# SimpleGoogleMapTest
This is just a simple test that shows a google map in a blazor interface. 
It reads by default a JSON file and gets weather stations info, then shows them on the map. By clicking on each station, it shows more info in a tooltip.
The code is for test ,not optimized, nor ready to use in a real project.
